Provide a response in this EXACT JSON format:
{
  "allocation": {
    "equity": 60,
    "debt": 30,
    "gold": 10
  },
  "emergency_fund": 180000,
  "health_score": 72,
  "action_items": [
    "Start a SIP of ₹10,000 per month in a Nifty 50 index fund",
    "Build emergency fund to ₹3 lakhs - keep it in a liquid fund or high-interest savings account",
    "Review and cut discretionary spending by 10% to increase savings rate"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Brief 2-3 sentence explanation of why this allocation suits them"
}

Use standard Indian asset allocation principles. Adjust equity % based on age (younger = more equity) and risk appetite. Be conservative with recommendations. Emergency fund should be 6 months of expenses. Health score should consider savings rate, emergency fund adequacy, and age-appropriate allocation."
